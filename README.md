# ChaiLens
ChaiLens is a fun project that uses OpenCV to automatically take chai orders based on a customer's preferences. The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze the customer's hand gestures and facial expressions and then allows the customer to customize their order. ChaiLens then sends the order to the staff, making the ordering process simpler and more interactive for the customer.
